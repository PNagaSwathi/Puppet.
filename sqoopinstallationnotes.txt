1) first download the tar from the sqoop website:http://ftp.wayne.edu/apache/sqoop/1.4.7/sqoop-1.4.7.bin__hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz

2) untar the tar ball and move it to the /usr/lib/sqoop directory
# tar -xvf sqoop-1.4.7.bin__hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz
# mv sqoop-1.4.7.bin__hadoop-2.6.0 /usr/lib/sqoop
# mv sqoop-env-template.sh sqoop-env.sh

3) Now that we have all the things that are needed for the sqoop to work let us set the environment so that sqoop 
coordinates with the other services like hadoop. This configuration resides in a file under the conf with the name 
sqoop-env.sh

add the below information to the file.
export HADOOP_COMMON_HOME=/root/hadoop-2.9.1 ---> this is the hadoop path specific to ur environment
export HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME=/root/hadoop-2.9.1

4) Set the environment varibles as well in the /etc/environment
export SQOOP_HOME=/usr/lib/sqoop
export SQOOP_CONF_DIR=$SQOOP_HOME/conf

5) Also set the PATH variable to point to the sqoop binaries in the /etc/profile
export PATH=$PATH:$SQOOP_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/bin


Now we are ready to go with the sqoop. Test whether everything is working by the below command
# sqoop version


Now we need to establish connectivity between sqoop and mysql database so that we can try some scenarios. for that we need to donload the mysql dirvers
